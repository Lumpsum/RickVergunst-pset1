##### Mr. Potatohead

App of an inital bare potato that you can give features by clicking the checkboxes, 
in order to resemble Mr. Potatohead of Toy Story.
It supports orientation changes and keeps track of the checkboxes that are checked.

DISCLAIMER
The saved state instance should work, but it behaves oddly sometimes. Even though the code should work and the logs are correct.
I have found not solution for this, even with the help of the TA's
